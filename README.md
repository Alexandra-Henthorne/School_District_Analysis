Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis

The basis of the analysis was to deterine and isolate Thomas High school. We were looking closely at  their budget and their math/ reading percentages in correlation to that.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?

By looking at the District Summary we  can see that there was over a 26 millon dollar budget for al 15 schools and the average pasing grade was 64.

How is the school summary affected?

The school summary is more in depth and ilustrates  what type of shcool the high school was, be it a charter school or District school. Based off of the that the data was then broken down into how much each student cost per the budget and what their avergae reading and math scores were . This allowed us to see  asnd idenity if one charter school or district schools made a difference but also if the budget the school was given played a part as well.

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?


How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

By separating them by grade we can see if the student are either progressing or digressing.

Scores by school spending

By looking at the data set for spending it is actually showing that the less amount of money spent per student generated  higher average score for math and reading. Whereas the more money spent  the student had the lowest overall passing percentage. 

Scores by school size

Obviously by looking at the numbers, the bigger the school the higher the budget meaning more capital per student. Taking a deeper look we can see that the smaller schools had a much higher percentage in reading and math which also are the charter or private schools. 
Scores by school type
